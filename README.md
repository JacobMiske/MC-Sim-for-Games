Monte Carlo Attempt to Solve Strategy in N.G.


SCORING:
1 	100 points
5 	50 points
Three 1's 	1,000 points
Three 2's 	200 points
Three 3's 	300 points
Three 4's 	400 points
Three 5's 	500 points
Three 6's 	600 points
1-2-3-4-5  	1500 points

Note that scoring combinations only count when made with a single throw. (Example: If a player rolls a 1 and sets it aside and then rolls two 1â€™s on their next throw, they only score 300 points, not 1000.)

Sometimes a single roll will provide multiple ways to score. For example, a player rolling 1-2-4-5-5-5 could score one of the following:

    100 points for the 1
    150 points for the 1 and a 5
    500 points for the three 5's
    600 points for the 1 and the three 5's

Caveat, at the end of game. If you go out, exceeding 5000 points, then the dice freeze, everyone gets one roll, if they bet the person who went out, they come on from behind.

WINNING:
The first player to score a total of 5,000 or more points wins, provided that no other players with a remaining turn can exceed that score.
